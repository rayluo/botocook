Boto 3 Cookbook
===============

Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for
Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use
of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. You can find the latest, most
up to date, documentation at `Read the Docs`_, including a list of
services that are supported.

.. _`Read the Docs`: https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

This repo aims to provide short but runnable code snippets as recipe,
to demonstrate how to use AWS services in Boto 3 (and sometimes Botocore).
These code snippets will NOT fully cover every detail in the aforementioned
official documentation, but they should give you a quick start.

The examples are organized in tests sub-directory, so that we can test them.
However the focus is not about test, so the use of assertions are rare.

Now you can start browsing the recipes in the tests sub-directory. Enjoy!
